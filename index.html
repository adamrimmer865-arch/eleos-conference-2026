        <strong>William Shakespeare once asked, “What’s in a name?”</strong>
        <br><br>
        Names carry stories, legacies, and expectations. Some names echo through history—Vanderbilt, Rockefeller. Others carry character—Mickey, Donald. Some even shape perception—President, King, or Pastor.
        <br><br>
        But beyond reputation or recognition, Scripture shows us that names matter to God. Jesus often changed names—Simon to Peter, Saul to Paul, Abram to Abraham. Each new name marked a new identity, a redeemed purpose, a divine encounter.
        <br><br>
        So to you, we offer this name: <strong>Eleos (ἔλεος)</strong>.
        <br><br>
        In Greek, <em>Eleos</em> means mercy, compassion, pity. It is the cry of the broken heart and the comfort of a loving Father. It is the character of Christ toward all who are weary, wounded, and waiting for renewal.
        <br><br>
        Eleos is for the hurting.<br>
        Eleos is for those who strive and struggle to overcome the pain of the past.<br>
        Generational curses, regrets, and failures all fall at the feet of Him who weeps over His people and whispers, <em>Eleos</em>.
        <br><br>
        It is our hope that during this conference, you will experience <em>Eleos</em>—
        not as a word, but as a Person.
        Not as a sound, but as a Presence.
        <br><br>
        And when you return home, may <em>Eleos</em> follow you, as the Psalmist declared:
        <br><br>
        <strong>“Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.” — Psalm 23:6</strong>
        <br><br>
        If you’ve only been surviving, we invite you to <em>Eleos</em>—
        where, in the power of Jesus’ Name,
        you will begin to live again.
