        <strong>“What’s in a name?”</strong><br><br>
        Names carry stories, legacies, and expectations. Some names echo through history—Vanderbilt, Rockefeller. Others carry character—Mickey, Donald. Some even shape perception—President, King, or Pastor.
        <br><br>
        But beyond reputation or recognition, Scripture shows us that names matter to God. Jesus often changed names—Simon to Peter, Saul to Paul, Abram to Abraham. Each new name marked a new identity, a redeemed purpose, a divine encounter.
        <br><br>
        So to you, we offer this name: <strong>Eleos (ἔλεος)</strong>.
        <br><br>
        In Greek, Eleos means mercy, compassion, pity. It is the cry of the broken heart and the comfort of a loving Father. It is the character of Christ toward all who are weary, wounded, and waiting for renewal.
        <br><br>
        Eleos is for the hurting.  
        Eleos is for those who strive and struggle to overcome the pain of the past.  
        Generational curses, regrets, and failures all fall at the feet of Him who weeps over His people and whispers, <em>Eleos.</em>
        <br><br>
        It is our hope that during this conference, you will experience Eleos— not as a word, but as a Person. Not as a sound, but as a Presence.
        <br><br>
        And when you return home, may Eleos follow you, as the Psalmist declared:  
        <em>“Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.” — Psalm 23:6</em>
        <br><br>
        If you’ve only been surviving, we invite you to Eleos—where, in the power of Jesus’ Name, you will begin to live again.

        <strong>What is Eleos?</strong><br><br>
        Eleos is a two-day conference dedicated to helping believers find healing, hope, and restoration through the mercy of Christ.
        <br><br>
        Hosted at <strong>First Baptist Church of Bolivar</strong>, this gathering brings together pastors, teachers, and leaders who share one mission—to see hearts renewed and lives changed through God’s Word.
        <br><br>
        Throughout the weekend, you’ll hear powerful messages from speakers like <strong>Adam Rimmer, Tommy Warner, Alfonso Gilbert, Rusty Keltner, Adam Barnhart, Kyle Rhea,</strong> and <strong>Matt Boatwright</strong>, each addressing the struggles that weigh on the soul—grief, trauma, addiction, anger, and the longing to be made whole again.
        <br><br>
        Worship, fellowship, and biblical teaching come together in a space where mercy isn’t just preached—it’s experienced.
        <br><br>
        If you’re looking for a place to rest, rebuild, and remember that God still heals the brokenhearted, <strong>Eleos is for you.</strong>
